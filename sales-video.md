# 1. Here’s who I am and what I do...

Hi I'm Hayden Erickson, seasoned software engineer, creator of the online
course ZERO to AI, and passionate teacher. I help people learn the fundamentals
of artificial intelligence and machine learning so that they can build
incredible software, advance their career, and ride the AI wave of the future.

# 2. Have you ever had any of these challenges... 
> This is where you take the customer’s perspective and discuss the problems and
> challenges they face in succeeding in the topic area you are going to be
> teaching.

Have you ever had your interest peaked by the idea of artificial intelligence
and machine learning, but been too intimidated by the concepts, didn't know
where to start, believed you lacked the necessary education, or just haven't
started yet?


# 3. Me too – here’s my story of struggle... 
> Share the struggles you’ve been through that relate to the topic you are
> teaching. So, if you’re teaching personal development, share a personal
> struggle you’ve had in finding your path and motivation in life. If business,
> share how hard it was when you began. Just be authentic and don’t feel like you
> have to share your entire life story. Just share some vignettes, some moments
> in time that were difficult.

When I first started I had no idea what I was doing, had no formal teaching on
the subject, had to review pretty much 100% of the concepts, and spent days on
end staring at equations trying to figure out what they meant.

# 4. Here’s my story of finding the solution... 
> Now share how you overcame your struggles. You don’t have to be perfect—it’s
> okay if you still struggle with the same things. But you do want to talk
> about the journey you went on to improve your life or business. Did you read

> What helped you improve?  

I read books on AI, countless research papers, articles, and blogs. I went to
many meetups on machine learning to learn from others in the field and had a
big breakthrough because I spent so much time staring at those equations.

# 5. Here’s my and my students results... 
> This is where you share the successes you’ve had after you went on your
> journey to solve your problems. It doesn’t have to be about having fame and
> riches. It can be simple stories of how your life changed in positive ways,
> and how others have changed too. You don’t have to share specific numbers or
> data—this isn’t about setting an expectation that your customers can have the
> exact same result (that’s illegal to promise). This is about sharing how your
> life transformed and how your students, if any, have improved their lives
> too.

All this work has had a profound impact on my life. I'm inspired almost
everyday by new AI research and I actually know what they're talking about.
I've given presentations on machine learning to people who HAVE taken formal
classes and they have told me they didn't learn anything I talked about in
their classes. Others have told me that my explanations really helped the ideas
to click, were simple, and made sense. Not only has learning these concepts
opened up my available world of knowledge, they have contributed significantly
to success and growth in my own career.

# 6. Here’s what I’m selling today... (overview)

I'm offering an online course today called Zero To AI. I created it because I
wanted to inspire others just as I was when I first started learning this. I
wanted to share the intuition I gained from the weeks and months spent learning
and show others that deep learning and AI aren't as complicated as they seem.

The course takes a gradual approach to the ideas and slowly builds up so you
don't get overwhelmed. I teach all the ideas from the ground up so you don't
need much background knowledge especially if you already know python.

The course lasts 5 weeks with a corresponding module for each week.

The first week teaches you about the neuron that makes up a neural network, how
it relates to our actual brain cells, and how it combines all of inputs into a
single output activation.

The second week covers how neurons are composed into layers, why these layers
exist, and how these layers create the structure of the neural network.

The third week goes over gradient descent which is how machines can learn from
data.

The fourth week teaches the backpropagation algorithm and how it is a natural
byproduct of the chain rule from calculus. We use the chain rule simply because
our neural network is just a chain of mathematic operations where the output
from one becomes the input to the next.

The fifth and final week covers how to actually train the neural network on a
dataset so that it can get good at a specific task.

All of the modules have a corresponding python notebook file which allows you
to create documentation alongside code that you can actually run. These
notebooks have detailed comments and descriptions that go into even more detail
than the videos. The code inside the notebooks shows you exactly how every
piece works and allows you to make changes to tweak and test on your own.

# 7. Here’s why it’s great for you... (benefits) 
> Now tell them even more benefits they’ll get when they get your product.
> Think about describing the overall transformation they’ll have in their life,
> what will change, the day-to- day improvements they’ll experience, how much
> better they’ll feel, etc.

If you are involved with software, deal with data on a day to day basis, or
just love the idea of smart tech then this course will expose you to the
amazing capabilities that deep learning and AI gives us. Neural networks are an
incredibly powerful tool that allows us to make predictions, automatically
recognize voice and images, generate speech, art, and music, make predictions
for ads and recommendations, improve search results, control robots and virtual
characters, beat humans at strategy games, and countless other superhuman
abilities.

# 8. Here’s why it’s different... (distinction) 
> This is where your homework pays off. What makes your program different from
> everyone else’s? What makes you different? Why will this work better than
> other things they’ve tried before? Why is it a better deal? etc. (The next
> video in this module will help you think through how you’re different, too).

Unlike MANY other PAID online courses on deep learning, this course actually
teaches you how they WORK and lets you write the code. Other courses literally
breeze over the structure of the network and then import a library!!! Seriously
they show you how to import a couple of functions and that's it. What if you
want to use a different library, what if the library changes, what if there's a
better library than the one they use, what if something breaks? If any of those
things happen you'll be completely lost because you won't actually know what's
going on under the hood. This course actually teaches you what's going on so
that you can use ANY library, debug when things break, and use a better library
if one comes out.

# 9. Here’s why it’s a great deal (price juxtaposition)... 
> This is all about price. Describe how much time or money they would spend
> trying to figure this out. Describe how much time and energy you spent
> figuring this out. Tell them how difficult it would be to get this elsewhere,
> or how much they’d have to pay to get it from you personally. That should all
> sound difficult and expensive. Then announce a great price. The goal is for
> them to say, “Wow. What a great deal an︎ it will save me so much struggle!”

You can go out and read several books on the subject, research which libraries
to use among the massive pool, figure out how to code it yourself, and review
the necessary calculus, linear algebra, and data science concepts. You can do
what I did and spend almost a year trying to understand it on your own. You
could buy another online course and either be overwhelmed and inundated with
theory and abstraction from an academic course, or literally learn how to
import a couple of functions from the non-academic courses. Or you could take
my course and get all of that in just 5 weeks, explained with real-world
analogies and fully transparent code examples. You can ask questions and have
them answered without the need to take difficult tests or quizzes. You can
avoid the stress and pressure that comes with trying to get a good grade and
actually focus on the material!

# 10. Here’s what else you get... (bonuses) 
> Bonus time! Tell them that when they buy today, they’ll also receive a bonus
> (or several) that will help them achieve or grow even faster and easier.
> Bonuses really help, so Brendon recommends taking the time to create them.
> Sell them with as much enthusiasm and details as you do the rest of the
> course.

If you buy the course you'll also get a library guide and a bonus python
notebook on convolutional neural networks. The library guide will compare and
contrast the myriad of neural network libraries covering what's good and bad
about each one and why you would use one over the other. There are a lot out
there and it can be difficult to know which one to use and why.

The bonus python notebook will discuss how neural networks can be extended and
optimized to handle images which is one of their biggest applications. This
bonus notebook shows you how neural networks can be extended to do even more
incredible things and why these extensions intuitively exist. Often times, the
most modern applications of neural nets don't just use the basic fully
connected architecture described in the course, they build on top of it adding
recurrent loops, different sub-modules, or entirely different operations
specific to the type of data they deal with.

# 11. Here’s why there is no risk... (guarantee) 
If you aren't satisfied with the course, you have 30 days to get your money back with no risk.

# 12. Here’s why to buy now.... (deadline, scarcity) 
Deep learning is taking over the way business show ads, surface content, and
target customers. It is changing the feeds you see on social media and
recommendations you get for products. It is revolutionizing the way virtual
characters engage with us in games and pushing the limits of what is possible
with computing. All of this is happening NOW, RIGHT NOW. Everyday new
applications of neural networks are published with incredible research findings
that have never been discovered. It is an exciting and ground breaking field to
be a part of.

# 13. Here’s an extra bonus to overcome your #1 objection... (surprise bonus)
### TODO
I know all of this might sound like it does not apply to you or that you would
have no use for it in your daily life which is why I'm including an extra
bonus. This bonus is a guide on all of the day to day applications of deep
learning that you can adapt for your own needs at work or with your own data.

# 14. Here’s why to buy now, again, and the full offer recap 
Just to recap When you buy the Zero to AI course you will receive 5 weeks of
videos and notebooks to teach you exactly how modern AI actually works with
accompanying code examples for you to tweak and test yourself. You will get a
guide on the most up to date deep learning libraries which will help you decide
which one to use and why after you complete the course. You will receive a
bonus python notebook which demonstrates how neural networks can be extended
and modified to handle different types of data, specifically images. As if that
was not enough you will also receive a real world application guide showing how
deep learning can be used in day to day life.
