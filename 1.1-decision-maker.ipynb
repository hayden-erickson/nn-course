    "Let's say we wanted to build something that would decide for us if we wanted to go to the movies. We could base our decision on 2 variables, how much money do we have and how many of our friends are going. These two variables are independent because how many of are friends are going to the movies does not affect how much money we have (if only it did). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we need to know both variables to make our decision. For instance, if we have enough money to go, but none of are friends are going then we probably won't want to go. On the other hand, if a lot of our friends are going, but we don't have the money we won't go either. Only the right combination of the variables leads to a yes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the answer is binary (yes or no) we can call this task a binary classification. We are trying to make something that can take in an amount of money, and a number of friends and output one of two classes, yes or no. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this task as a function\n",
    "\n",
    "If we simply created this function with no other variables there would be no machine learning involved. There is no state that we can update to affect what decision is made. So we know we need some other values in order to affect the final decision. Also we need a way to combine the extra values with the input to actually have our function return a 1 or a 0 for a yes or no. One way to do this is with a threshold. We can say that if our combine inputs exceed some value the our answer is yes and if they're below some value then no. \n"
