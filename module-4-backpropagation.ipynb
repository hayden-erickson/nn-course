    "This is how our network performs gradient descent. By treating the network as a chain of functions we can use the chain rule to find the gradients for every single weight. Using the gradients, we can update the weights and biases and make the network perform slightly better. We repeat this process until the network stops improving or after a fixed number of iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what is our actual chain of operations that we will have our network perform? The first operation is to multiply the weights by our input and add the biases. The second is the activation function which takes in the output of the previous operation. The third is the cost function which takes in the output of the activation function. This would be the exact steps if we had a network with only one layer. If we use more layers we just repeat the first two steps for each layer.\n",

    "We ultimately want to lower the cost or make the answers the network gives us closer to their actual value which we get from our labeled data. Therefore, we want to find the gradient of the cost function and use that to get the gradients of our weights and biases with respect to the cost. In other words we will find out what effect each weight and bias has on the cost function. This effect represents the slope of the cost function in the dimension of a particular weight or bias. That slope is what we want to \"roll\" down by subtracting it from the particular weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we compute the gradient for the weights in our network? It is similar to how we found the gradients for the slope and y intercept of our best fit line in the previous module except we have one extra step which is the activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradients for the weights and biases in our weighted input function, number 1 above, is the same as with our best fit line. The gradient for the cost function is the same as well. The only difference is now we need to know the gradient of the activation function. However, once we have that, we can find the gradients for all the weights and biases.\n",

Using this value, we can subtract it from the weight or bias to make it \"roll\" down the hill. \n",

These values tell us how much a change in the weight or bias affects the final cost and whether that relationship is positive or negative. \n",

In that sense it tells us the steepness and direction of the hill. \n",

This term is precisely how we can allow our gradients to propagate backwards across multiple layers, hence backpropagation. However, this is really just the chain rule which we're using because we have a chain of operations where the output from one goes on to be the input of the next. The equation for the biases in $L1$ is the same except for the very last term which we replace with $\\frac{\\partial z^{L1}}{\\partial b^{L1}}$ and we've already determined that this term is just 1 so you can ignore it if you like.\n",
